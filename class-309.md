## [Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

*Functional Programming* is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

Pure Functions:
- return the same result if given the same arguments
- do not cause observable side effects

Immutable Dat:
- unchanging over time
- unable to be changed after it is created

> Pure functions + Immutable Data = Referential Transparency

Referential Transparency:

- consistently yielding the same result for the same input

Functions as First Class Entities:

- functions are **also** treated as values **and** used as data

Higher-Order Functions:

-take one or more functions as arguments **OR**
- return a function as its result

## [Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability (with Examples!)](https://dev.to/healeycodes/refactoring-javascript-for-performance-and-readability-with-examples-1hec)

*hash function* is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table

Strategies for easier to read code:

- Return early from functions
- Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
-Check for Web APIs before implementing your own functionality
