## JavaScript Ch. 10 - Error Handling and Debugging

**Execution Context**

- Global Context: Code that is in the script, but not in a function

- Function Context: Code that is being run within a function

- Eval Context (Not Shown): Text is executed like code in an internal function called eval()

*Debugging* is the process of finding errors through deduction.

If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an *exception*

  - Details of Error Objects can be found on pg. 459-461

  - When dealing with errors, you can use the *try, catch, finally* statements to handle it gracefully and give users helpful feedback.

Pg. 485 lists many common errors that may cause issues when writing script
