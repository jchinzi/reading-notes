Routes can be managed in separate modules from the main server, allowing us to extract that logic and wiring to be more topical.

How does this change the serverâ€™s role?

index.js - Entry Point
server.js - Hub, Exported Server
models/categories.js, etc - Data Models
routes/categories.js, etc - Routers and Handlers
