### Questions:

**Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development**

- TDD forces the developer to think through what the code *ought* to be doing because they are writing a test to check for specific returns or behavior.
- TDD makes debugging easier by catching bugs early in the process.  Tests can also be written to check for specific bugs.
- TDD can be an enjoyable part of coding once you learn the basics

**In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**

These are helper functions meant to be used when there is work that needs to be done repeatedly for multiple tests, such as initializing or clearing a database that a test will interact with.  beforeEach() and afterEach() can also handle asynchronous code by taking a 'done' parameter or returning a promise.

**What is one downside of Test Driven Development**

There is a fairly significant upfront time commitment to TDD - that time commitment usually begins to taper off over time because the resulting code is cleaner and easier to build on.  However, for small projects or code that is unlikely to be reusued or maintained then TDD may not be worth the time investment.

**Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**

Classes allow for inheritance by extending classes and using super();

**Name a use case for a static method**

Static methods are called without instantiating their class and are not callable when the class is instantiated.  They are meant to provide class-specific methods for object-oriented programming.

**Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves**
```
const mapTwoToThe = (arr) => {
  let newArr = arr.map(val =>
    Math.pow(2, val));
  return newArr;
};
````
Map is a higher order function that iterates over an array applies a given function to each element of that array, returning a new array.  In this case, the returned array will be an array of values that have been raised to the power of 2.
