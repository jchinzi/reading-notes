[First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

This blog encourages project owners to actively make an effort towards encouraging new coders to interact with their open source projects by explicitly marking some easy issues as 'first-timers-only' (i.e. the issue should be saved for those who have not yet made a contribution to an open source project).  Furthermore, the blog calls on those project owners to go further and be available as support for those new contributors in order to walk them through the process of making a contribution (as oftentimes newbies may be able to address the technical issue but may not know the protocol of how to contribute that code)

There is also a list of links to resources specifically targeted for those new to open source projects - including a site called 'Good First Issues' that aggregates recent issues on GitHub that are tagged specifically as such.
