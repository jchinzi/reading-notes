## HTML Ch. 4 - Links

Links to outside websites are created using the anchor element and absolute URLs, as shown below:

> `<a href="http://www.websitelink.com">Website Name</a>`

Alternately, to link to another page within the same website a shorter relative URL can be used:

> `<a href="relativeLink.html">Page Name</a>`

|Relative Link Type|Example of Relative Link|
|:--|--:|
|Same Folder|link.html|
|Child Folder|child/link.html|
|Grandchild Folder|child/grandchild/link.html|
|Parent Folder|../link.html|
|Grandparent Folder|../../link.html|

A link can also prompt the users email program to open by using the following code:

>`<a href="mailto:me@example.org">Email Me</a>`

If you want the link to automatically open in a new window rather than redirecting the current window, use the target attribute:

>`<a href="http://www.websitelink.com" target="_blank">Website Name</a>`

You an also use the id attribute to link to a specific location on a page.  ID is targeted using # (just like in CSS).
