## Article "Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming"

*It is very difficult to learn more than one thing at a time*

- As a student studying software development, it is therefore very difficult to learn how to code a problem when you don't fully understand the problem when expressed in plain language

- In a professional setting, it will be much harder to build a solution if you don't fully understand the problem that you are being asked to solve

Both situations can be addressed in one of two ways: 

- Make the problem domain easier

- Get better at understanding the problem domain

## JavaScript Ch. 3 - Object Literals

**property**: a variable that is part of an object

**method**: a function that is part of an object (ergo, the value of a method is *always* a function)

**key**: the unique name assigned to a value within an object.  An object cannot have two keys with the same name

  - Within an object, each key is separated from its value using a colon.  The pair is then followed by a comma

  > keyName: value,

The properties or methods of an object can be accessed using dot notation.  Properties can also be accessed using square brackets
