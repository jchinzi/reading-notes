## [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

The main takeaway from this article is that there is no magic formula to building the perfect team, at least as far as choosing team members goes.  Rather, teams are successful when there is a sense of psychological safety within the group.  This means that members feel confidant that they can contribute to group discussions and let their guards down personally without recrimination.  While this means that it can be difficult to assemble a 'perfect team', the good news is that existing teams can be made more content and more effective by consciously seeking to create a psychologically safe space within the group.
