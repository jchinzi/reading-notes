## HTML Ch. 7 - Forms

Forms come in many *forms*, including text, choices like buttons or checkboxes, submitting forms or uploading files.

Information sent from a browser to a server is sent in name/value pairs.

`<form>` elements contain form controls
The *action* attribute of the `<form>` element contains the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information with the form is submitted

Forms can be sent using one of tow methods: *get* or *post*

`<input>` is used to create values like *type*, *name* and *size* that describe the input the element will be creating

Much of this chapter describes different elements used to create forms - refer back to the text for specific examples.

**form validation** is used to ensure users enter information into a form that can be understood once submitted
