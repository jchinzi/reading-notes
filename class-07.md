## Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

 - A **model** describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. 
- An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an **object-oriented model**.

*Object Oriented Programming - Step by Step*
1. The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
1. The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
1. The object is stored in a variable for later use.

*Final Take Aways*
- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
