## JavaScript Ch. 4 - Decisions and Loops

|Term|Definition|
|:--|--:|
|Switch Statement|Indicates multiple possible code options that may run depending on the **switch value** assigned.  Once one of the codes is run, a **break** statement prevents any further **switch statements** from running|
|Type Coercion|When JavaScript converts a data type in an attempt to complete an operation|
|Unary Operator|An operator that returns a result with just one operand|

<p style="text-align: center;">Loops check a condition.  If it returns true, a code block will run.  Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again.  This will continue until the condition returns false.</p>

|Loop Type|Description|
|:--|--:|
|For|Runs code **for** a specific number of times, often by using a counter.|
|While|Code will run for as long as the specified condition is true - useful when you don't know how many times the code will need to run.|
|Do While|Similar to *while* loops, **except that** it will always run the statement inside the curly braces at least once, *even if the condition evaluates to false*.

|Term|Definition|
|:--|--:|
|break|Causes the termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code outside the loop.|
|continue|Tells the interpreter to continue with the current iteration, and then check the condition again|
