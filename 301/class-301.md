## [Shay Howeâ€™s Intro to RWD](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/)

RWD: Responsive Web Design, or the practice of building a website suitable to work on devices of every size

- RWD has become particularly important with the rise of mobile internet usage (smart phones, etc)

*Responsive*: Reacts quickly and positively to change

*Adaptive*: Easily modified for a new purpose or situation

*Mobile*: Built separately and specifically for a mobile device

*Flexible Layout*: The practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid capable of dynamically resizing to any width

*Media Queries*: Provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances

- Mobile First approach is one technique that targets smaller viewports (such as mobile devices) first, and then uses media queries to add styles as the viewport grows

*Flexible Media*: Addresses the need for media to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes

To get embedded media to be fully responsive: 

- the embedded element needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element
- the parent element needs to have a width of 100% so that it may scale based on the width of the viewport
- the parent element needs to have a height of 0 to trigger the hasLayout mechanism (IE)
