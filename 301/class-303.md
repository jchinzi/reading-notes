## [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

*Flexbox* provides a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container
- Flex containers expand items to fill available free space or shrink items to prevent overflow
- This is particularly useful if items are dynamic or their size is unknown
- Flexbox layout is direction-agnostic, referencing instead a main axis (main-start to main-end) and cross-axis (cross-start to cross-end)

The container element must be set to display: flex; for flexbox properties to be applied to the items within the container

This site lists varies properties available for both the parent and children elements, including visual depictions and written descriptions of how each property functions - a very useful reference site when working with flexbox in CSS.
