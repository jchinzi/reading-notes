## HTML Ch. 16 - Images

- *width* and *height* properties can be used on images just like any other box

- using consistently sized images throughout a website can make the CSS much easier (set small/med/large image classes, etc.)

- similarly, classes can be created to *float* image left or right

- *background-image* can be used to create a background for any element.  The *background-repeat* attribute can dictate how or if the image in the background repeats

- pg. 416 details shorthand options for setting up background images

**sprite**: when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface
