## HTML Ch. 15 - Layout

(For notes focus on p.358 - p.364 see [Class 04 Notes](class-04.md))

**position**

*static*: default

*relative*: moves an element in relation to where it would normally have been in normal flow

*absolute*: takes box out of normal flow

*fixed*: type of absolute positioning that is fixed in relation to the browser window

**float** allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible

**clear** allows you to say that no element within the same containing element should touch the indicated side of the box (*left, right, both or none*)

*Fixed Width Layouts* do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window

*Liquid Layout Designs* stretch and contract based on the browser window

>Multiple CSS files can be used within a single page
